# Personal Portfolio Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Aim

The aim of this project was to create a portfolio website using Javascript, React, HTML and CSS. The idea behind the website was to learn how to use react while simultaneously creating my own website where I could display my portfolio.
